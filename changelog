== 1.0.1 ==

Bugs fixed (references to GIP ticket numbers in [])
  - The dynamic providers were parsing the VO list differently than in
    previous cases [1]
  - For an SRM SE, GlueSEArchitecture is changed from "disk" to "other".
    This avoids the classicSE script trying to execute df in the wrong
    places [2, 8]
  - $GIP_LOCATION/etc/gip.conf was not being read in some cases due to
    invalid path expansion [3]
  - Multiple collector hosts were not getting parsed correctly (GIP
    ticket [4]
  - OSG Version is now published along with the software tags [5]
  - PBS dynamic provider was not parsing waiting jobs correctly (GIP
    ticket [6]
  - For non-PBS sites using dynamic dcache, GlueSEUniqueID was not being
    correctly generated [7]
  - GlueCESEBindCEAccessPoint will not double-count the GlueSAPath now
  - Wrong permissions and ownership were generated for
    dcache_storage.conf, gip.conf
  - CESEBind now advertises /UNAVAILABLE instead of dropping the
    attribute if the access point is not set
  - SRM hostname was being advertised based on reverse DNS, which is a
    problem for sites where the SRM host is a CNAME instead of an A
    name.  We now print out the admin-specified hostname if the IP
    matches.

== 1.0.0_rc1 ==

* Fixes: Unique name for SE Control protocol; VO view of SA now
  matches SA unique ID.
* Bugfix: Don't assume OSG_GIP_SIMPLIFIED_PATH exists
